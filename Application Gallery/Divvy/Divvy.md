### Business Sense
- GIS Geographic information system (GIS) is a computer system designed to capture, store, 
manipulate, analyze, manage, and present all types of spatial or geographical data. The acronym 
GIS is sometimes used for geographical information science or geospatial information studies to 
refer to the academic discipline or career of working with geographic information systems and is 
a large domain within the broader academic discipline of Geoinformatics.What goes beyond a GIS 
is a spatial data infrastructure, a concept that has no such restrictive boundaries.

- Data Analysis Analysis of data is a process of inspecting, cleaning, transforming, and modeling 
data with the goal of discovering useful information, suggesting conclusions, and supporting 
decision-making. Data analysis has multiple facets and approaches, encompassing diverse 
techniques under a variety of names, in different business, science, and social science domains.

- Big Data Visualization Visualizations help people see things that were not obvious to them 
before. Even when data volumes are very large, patterns can be spotted quickly and easily. 
Visualizations convey information in a universal manner and make it simple to share ideas with 
others. It lets people ask others, “Do you see what I see?” And it can even answer questions like 
“What would happen if we made an adjustment to that area?”. Data visualization presents the 
data in a way that the director can easily interpret, saving time and energy.

### Technologies Used In Project
- Mapbox Offers commercial mapping services. Many of them use OpenStreetMap data and involve large open-source
efforts.

- Leaflet A modern open-source JavaScript library for mobile-friendly interactive maps. Works efficiently across all major desktop and mobile platforms out of the box, taking advantage of HTML5 and CSS3 on modern browsers while still being accessible on older ones. It can be extended with a huge amount of plugins, has a beautiful, easy to use and well-documented API and a simple, readable source code that is a joy to contribute to.

- Python A widely used general-purpose, high-level programming language. Its design philosophy emphasizes code readability, and its syntax allows programmers to express concepts in fewer lines of code than would be possible in languages such as C++ or Java. Provides constructs intended to enable clear programs on both a small and large scale. Supports multiple programming paradigms, including object-oriented, imperative and functional programming or procedural styles. It features a dynamic type system and automatic memory management and has a large and comprehensive standard library.

- Flask A lightweight web application framework written in Python and based on the WSGI toolkit and Jinja2 
template engine. Takes the flexible Python programming language and provides a simple template for web 
development. Flask can be used to save time building web applications.

- Mongo DB A document database that provides high performance, high availability, and easy scalability.
